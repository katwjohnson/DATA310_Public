# Shirt Design

## Draft Design
For my draft design I decided to have my content image be of Wren since it is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus. Also, I have unintentionally had class in every academic building but Wren has been my favorite. Then for the style image I used a stock image of binary code since we are in the Jump Start for Data Science Program.
